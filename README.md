# ForAJob

# This repository is designed for future employers. Where every language I have learned up to this day has been documented in the following order:

1. Dictionary-like txt file demostrating knowledge of language componenets (Also for personal reminder use)
2. A basic file or program demonstrating use of each of the language components in a practical sense. IE: Demostrating the use of unordered lists in HTML
3. A single-language project 
4. A multi-language project. IE: A reactive website using JS, CSS, HTML
5. IF possible: A real world application of the language. This can involve a product I have coded, or a machine I have put together. That will be accompanied by success statistics like revenue, 0 to production ready timelines, and/or a recruiter / developer accessible version of the program.

Now a message to the following company's recruiters: Lockheed Martin, Delta Airlines, United Airlines, Northrop Grumman, Boeing, Airbus, Embraer, Bombardier, SpaceX, Tesla, Raytheon, and other defense industry or aviation companies:

If you feel my work is sufficient, please reach out. It would be an honor to work with any of you. 

If you have visited this README file prematurely: HTML and CSS will be the first presented in this repository. Then I plan on adding the JavaScript series of languages, then SQL, then Java, then the C series of languages, then Python. Followed promptly by AWS and other languages I see fit.

And a little more about me: My entire background is in aviation. I'm pursuing a job as a Legacy Mainline Airline Pilot. I already have 141 PPL Credit, and just passed my IR stage 1. I'm also currently pursuing a 4 year in Computer Science: Software Engineering. I've worked under Delta as a contractor, and United. This information is relevant as I seek a programming job in an aviation business.
